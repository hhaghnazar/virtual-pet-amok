# Virtual Pets Amok

Escape into a magical wonderland where pets run amok inside your shelter.
Since we began accepting different types of pets, everything has become disheveled
You still have to feed, provide water, and play with your pets to keep them healthy.
You must now take care of Organic, Virtual, and Robotic pets which can get difficult at times.  
Always remember:  
1. That robotic pets do not require any food or hunger to sustain themselves.
2. That you have to keep your pets happy or their health will drop.
3. That you will have to oil up your robotic pets because their health will drop.
4. That the cat litterbox needs to be emptied on a regular basis or the cats' health will drop.
5. That the dog cages have to be cleaned out on a regular basis or the dogs' health will drop.
6. Tending to your animals will increase their health level.
